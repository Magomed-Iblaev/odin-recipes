    <h3>Ingredients for a serving of 5</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>7 potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2kg flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2l water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp salt </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>150ml kefir</li>
        <li>150ml mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1pinch Black pepper ground</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>200ml water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan bring water and meat to a boil. Once the foam appears on the surface, change the water to clean and bring it to a boil again. If the foam appears, remove it. Once the water starts boiling, add a whole carrot and onion (these are just for the broth taste and will be thrown away later). Also add salt and bay leaves. Simmer with a lid on for approximately 1,5 hours.</li>
        <li>While the meat is being cooked, we start preparing dough for our galnash. In a large bowl, mix flour with egg and water. Knead with hands until a smooth dough forms. Cover with a kitchen towel and set aside for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile peel potatoes, cut in half and add to a pot with boiling water. Once they are cooked through, remove them and set aside.</li>
        <li>Get back to our dough and cut it into 3 equal parts. Roll out each parts with a rolling pin, to approx. 1 cm thick. Then cut them into 2 cm wide stripes. Cut each stripe crosswise into small pieces, these small dough pieces will be future galnash.</li>
        <li>Now the most interesting part begins, as we start to shape our dough into galnash. Take one little dough piece and place your thumb on top of it. Then, press it with your thumb, roll the dough on a flat surface shaping it into a sort of seashell.</li>
        <li>Shaping all the dough pieces into galnash will take a while. By the time you are done, meat should be ready. Remove carrot and onion from the broth. Take out meat and set aside</li>
        <li>Put the broth on high heat and once it is boiling again, put all the galnash there for 5-7 minutes, while stirring continuously. Remove ready galnash from broth and place on a large platter. Then place cooked meat and potatoes on top of galnash. The dish is served on a platter to share.</li>
        <li>Prepare garlic sauce: mix kefir and mayonnaise in 1:1, add finely grated garlic to it. Mix it good and season with black pepper. Sauce is ready. Serve it in individual bowls, as everyone would dip their galnash into the sauce.</li>
        <li> Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
